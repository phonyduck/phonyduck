### Description

Abus 65/30 Twin Pack 4-Pin Padlocks from Amazon. They come keyed alike, but the binding order is different.

I had so much fun with those little things, it's the best practice lock a newbie can wish for.

### Methods

- raked
- zipped
- SPP'd
- with that easy bitting, the straight edge of an upside down pick works best.

### Notes

- Spools! I think 2 Spools. I get counter rotation when SPP'ing.
