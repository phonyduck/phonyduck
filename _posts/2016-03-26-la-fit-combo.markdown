### Description

My first lock! My first set of picks and practice locks was in the mail, and I found this little one in the kitchen drawers.

This is my flatmates old gym lock, branded LA Fitness. Apparently they give these out when you sign up. They are complete junk, my guess would be that the gym staff can pick them easily. And when the treadmill obliterates all memory of the combination, they can swoop in and save the day.

### Methods

- picket using shackle tension
- picked aligning the grooves in the wheels

### Notes

- It's so flimsy, turning the shackle after resetting the combination, changes the combination during the 90 degree turn. Totally annoying.
